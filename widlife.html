<div class="p1"><h2>srilankan elephant</h2> The Sri Lankan subspecies is the largest and also the darkest of the Asian elephants, 
with patches of depigmentation—areas with no skin color—on its 
ears, face, trunk and belly. Once found throughout the
 tear-shaped island at the bottom of India’s southern 
 tip, these elephants are now being pushed into smaller
 areas as development activities clear forests and disrupt
 their ancient migratory routes.<br><br>

The herd size in Sri Lanka ranges from 12-20 individuals or more.
 It is led by the oldest female, or matriarch. In Sri Lanka, 
 herds have been reported to contain nursing units, consisting 
 of lactating females and their young, and juvenile care units,
 containing females with juveniles. The Sri Lankan elephant 
 population has fallen almost 65% since the turn of the 19th
 century. Today, the Sri Lanka elephant is protected under the 
 Sri Lankan law and killing one carries the death penalty.
 <br><br>Elephas maximus maximus is the type subspecies of the
 Asian elephant, first described by Carl Linnaeus under 
 the binominal Elephas maximus in 1758.[2]

The Sri Lankan elephant population is now largely restricted 
to the dry zone in the north, east and southeast of Sri Lanka.
 Elephants are present in Udawalawe National Park, Yala National
 Park, Lunugamvehera National Park, Wilpattu National Park and 
 Minneriya National Park but also live outside protected areas.</div>

<div class="p2"><h2>srilankan Leopard</h2>Leopard
Perhaps the most elusive cat in the world, the leopard reigns 
supreme on Sri Lanka. With no lions or tigers to threaten its
 position, leopards in Sri Lanka are more casual than they are
 elsewhere in the world and can often be seen lounging around 
 in the treetops.<br><br> They are also much bigger than leopards in 
 Africa or India, where they must compete with other carnivores
 for food. Not so in Sri Lanka.<br><br>

Best places to see leopards in Sri Lanka
If leopards are what you are after then 
head to Yala National park, the area with 
the highest leopard density.<br><br>
Best time to see leopards in Sri Lanka
Visit Yala in the dry season from May to October, when vegetation
 is less thick, and it’ll be much easier to spot this
 beautiful big cat.</div>
